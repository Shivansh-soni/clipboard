# TODO: User-Specific Clipboards & Admin-Only User Creation

This document outlines the work required to implement:

1. **User-specific clipboards**: Each clipboard item belongs to a particular user.
2. **Admin-only user creation**: No open signup; admin creates user accounts via the admin interface or API.

---

## Phase 1: Requirements & Planning

- [x] **1.1 Clarify functional requirements**

  - [x] Define how admin creates users (UI/API/CLI).
  - [x] Determine password/invite flows: email invite link with token.
  - [x] Confirm sign-in flow: email/password login.
  - [x] Determine user roles: "admin" and "user".
  - [x] Data privacy: users see only their own clipboard items; admin can see all.
  - [x] Focus on online functionality; offline-first is out of scope.

- [x] **1.2 Review current architecture**

  - [x] Examine Appwrite project settings.
  - [x] Check Appwrite database/collections structure.
  - [x] Review Next.js API routes and auth context.
  - [x] Environment variables configured.

- [x] **1.3 Identify security considerations**
  - [x] Disable public sign-up in Appwrite.
  - [x] Secure storage of Admin API keys.
  - [x] Define access control rules.
  - [x] Implement rate limiting (via Appwrite).
  - [x] Ensure HTTPS usage.

## Phase 2: Backend Model & Appwrite Configuration

- [x] **2.1 Modify ClipboardItem data model**

  - [x] Added `userId` field to `ClipboardItem`.
  - [x] Updated TypeScript interfaces.
  - [x] Created database schema in Appwrite.

- [x] **2.2 Set up user management in Appwrite**
  - [x] Created `users` collection with proper attributes.
  - [x] Created `invitations` collection for invitation flow.
  - [x] Set up database indexes for performance.
  - [x] Configured Appwrite authentication settings.

## Phase 3: API & Authentication

- [x] **3.1 Authentication service**

  - [x] Implemented user login/logout.
  - [x] Added password reset flow.
  - [x] Created session management.

- [x] **3.2 User management service**

  - [x] User CRUD operations.
  - [x] Invitation management.
  - [x] Role-based access control.
  - [x] User status management.

- [x] **3.3 Secure API routes**
  - [x] Created protected route component.
  - [x] Implemented admin middleware.
  - [x] Added request validation.

## Phase 4: Frontend Implementation

- [x] **4.1 Authentication UI**

  - [x] Login form.
  - [x] Signup form (invitation-based).
  - [x] Password reset flow.

- [x] **4.2 Admin Dashboard**

  - [x] User management interface.
  - [x] Invitation system.
  - [x] Role management.
  - [x] User status management.
  - [x] Implemented user listing with pagination.
  - [x] Added user role update functionality.
  - [x] Added user deletion with confirmation.
  - [x] Implemented invitation sending with validation.

- [ ] **4.3 User Profile**
  - [ ] Profile page.
  - [ ] Password change form.
  - [ ] Account settings.

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

- [ ] **5.1 Unit Testing**

  - [ ] Test user service functions.
  - [ ] Test authentication flows.
  - [ ] Test admin operations.

- [ ] **5.2 Integration Testing**

  - [ ] Test complete user flows.
  - [ ] Test permission boundaries.
  - [ ] Test error handling.

- [ ] **5.3 Deployment**
  - [ ] Update deployment scripts.
  - [ ] Configure production environment variables.
  - [ ] Perform smoke tests.

## Recent Updates

- **2024-06-21**:
  - Fixed user management UI issues
  - Implemented proper error handling in user service
  - Added loading states and feedback
  - Fixed role-based access control in the admin dashboard

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

- [ ] Add email service for invitations and password resets.
- [ ] Implement audit logging for admin actions.
- [ ] Add user activity monitoring.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints.
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication.
- [ ] Implement user impersonation for admin support.

## Notes

- All database IDs and collection names are stored in environment variables.
- The system uses JWT for session management.
- Admin users can manage all aspects of the application.
- Regular users can only access their own clipboard items.
